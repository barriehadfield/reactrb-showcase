### Using NPM and Webpack alongside Rails

I like to keep my front-end and back-end assets separate and in an ideal world, all my Rails related assets would be Ruby Gems and all the front-end assets will be Node Modules installed by NPM. This is however not always achievable.

I have found Webpack and Rails to be an excellent combination which allows for all the front end assets to be installed via NPM which then play very nicely with Webpack which will co-exist happily with Sprockets. Pretty much every front end library is packaged with NPM these days so it is easy to get help and most things just work.

+ [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
+ [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)

This tutorial requires that Ruby, Rails, NPM and Webpack are installed. Please see their websites for installation instructions.

### Technologies highlighted in this showcase app

+ For the backend we are using Rails 4.2.6 with Ruby 2.3.1
+ NPM and Webpack to manage front end assets
+ [React Rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) to use React with Rails
+ [Reactrb](https://github.com/reactrb/reactrb) to write reactive UI components with Ruby's elegance
+ [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) to show how to use native React components in Reactrb

## Setup

### Step 1: Creating a new Rails application

	rails new reactrb-showcase
	cd reactrb-showcase
	bundle install

You should have a empty Rails application

	rails s

And in your browser

	http://localhost:3000/

You should be seeing the Rails Welcome aboard page. Great, Rails is now installed. Lets get started with the interesting stuff.

### Step 2: Adding Reactrb

[We will use the Reactrb Rails Generator Gem](https://github.com/loicboutet/reactive-rails-generator)

In your `Gemfile`

	gem "reactrb-rails-generator"

then

	bundle update
	rails g reactrb:install
	bundle update

At this stage Reactrb is installed but we don't have any components yet. Lets create via the generator:

	rails g reactrb:component Home::Show

This will add a new Component at app/views/components/home/show.rb

Have a look at this component as it provides the basis for all other Reactrb components you will write. Note that all Reactrb components inherit from `React::Component::Base` but you are free to `include React::Component::Base` instead if you prefer your components inheriting from other classes. Also note how `params` are declared and the `before_mount` (and friends) macros as you will use these extensively. Finally note that every component must have one `render` methord which must return just one DOM `element` which in this example case is a `div`.

Next let's get this simple component rendering on a page. For that we will need a rails controller and a route.

	rails generate controller home

And add a route to your `routes.rb`

	get 'home' => 'home#show'

A method in the HomeController which will render the component.

	class HomeController < ApplicationController
	  def show
	  end
	end

And finally a view app/views/home/show.erb

	<%= react_component "Home::Show" %>

And if all has gone well, you should be rewarded with `Home::Show` in your browser. If you open your JavaScript console you can also check which version of React has been loaded

	React.version

A note on React versions: Reactrb includes the [React Rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) gem which includes a copy of the React source. Multiple copies of React being included cause untold problems so pay particular attention to the version of React you have (via the React Rails gem) and the version we are about to install via NPM. We will need to ensure these versions are the same. At the time writing, the React version being installed is 15.0.2 so we install the same version via NPN. To change this, see [React Rails versions](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails/blob/master/VERSIONS.md) which will then let you specify which version of React to include via the React Rails gem.

### Step 3: Webpack for managing front-end assets

[We will use the Webpack Rails Gem](https://github.com/mipearson/webpack-rails)

Run through the Installation instructions and you will end up with the following new files:

	package.json (for managing your NPM modules)
	procfile (for starting webpack-dev-server alongside your rails server)
	webpack\application.js (for requiring JavaScript libraries for inclusion by Webpack)
	config\webpack.config.js (for configuring Webpack)

Also note that your `.gitignore` now includes

	# Added by webpack-rails
	/node_modules
	/public/webpack

Assuming that you have NPM already installed (if you do not then you need to install it now), run

	npm install

which will download `webpack-dev-server` and other components into your `node-modules` folder.

One final thing we need to do is add the entry point to our Rails application so Webpack can hot-load its assets in development mode

`<%= javascript_include_tag *webpack_asset_paths("application") %>`

Assuming all went well you can now start your rails server agin using foreman

	foreman start

At this point you should have a working server with Webpack hot-loading any components added via NPM.

### Step 4: Installing React using NPM and Webpack

One consideration that you need to pay close attention to is the version of React being included by the [React Rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) gem and the version being included by Webpack via NPM. I would suggest you use the React version supplied by the gem and set the NPM version accordingly. This will create a happy medium where you will know that React Rails is using a supported version of React and all your front-end assets versions are locked to the same React version by Webpack.    

Installing React is very simple via NPM (note the @version which matches the version of React you have installed via the React Rails gem)

	npm install react@15.0.2 react-dom@15.0.2 --save

This will install React and also ReactDOM into your `node-modules` folder and also add the fact that these are installed to your `package.json`. You can now delete your `node-modules` folder at any time and simply `npm install` to install everything listed in `package.json`. Webpack does an excellent job of managing dependancies between NPM assets but you might find yourself deleting your `node-modules` folder fairly often as that is often the advice to resolve strange conflicts.

add ReactDOM to your `webpack/application.js`

	ReactDOM = require('react-dom')

If you refresh your browser and check the React version should see the latest version ("15.1.0" at time of writing). If you are seeing that version number and no React warnings then all has worked properly and we are ready to start writing some Reactrb components.

## Working with React Bootstrap

[We will be using React Bootstrap which is a native React library](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

The main purpose for React Bootstrap is that it abstracts away verbose HTML & CSS code into React components which makes it a lot cleaner for React JSX developers. One of the very lovely things about Reactrb is that we already work in beautiful Ruby. To emphasise this point, consider the following:

Sample 1 - In HTML (without React Bootstrap):

	<button id="something-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-success btn-sm">
	  Something
	</button>
	$('#something-btn').click(someCallback);

Sample 2 - In JSX (with React Bootstrap components):

	<Button bsStyle="success" bsSize="small" onClick={someCallback}>
	  Something
	</Button>

Sample 3 - In Reactrb (without React Bootstrap):

	button.btn_success.btn_sm {'Something'}.on(:click) do
		someMethod
	end

Sample 4 - In Reactrb (with React Bootstrap):

	Bs.Button(bsStyle: 'success' bsSize: "small").on(:click) do
		someMethod
	end

As you can see, sample 3 & 4 are not that different and as a Reactrb developer, I actually prefer sample 3. If I were a JavaScript or JSX developer I would completely understand the advantage of abstracting Bootstrap CSS into React Components so I don't have to work directly with CSS and JavaScript but this is not the case with Reactrb as CSS classes are added to HTML elements with simple dot notation:

	span.pull_right {}

compiles to (note the conversion from _ to -)

	<span class='pull-right'></span>

So I hear you ask: why if I prefer the non-React Bootstrap syntax why am worrying about React Bootstrap? For one very simple reason: Bootstrap JavaScript based components will not preform as they do with React as without React. Anything that requires `bootstrap.js` will not play nicely with with React and without the React Bootstrap project you would need to implement all that functionality yourself. A good example of this are Bootstrap Navbars which are a combination of CSS and JavaScript, all of which has been re-implemented with React by the React Bootstrap contributors.

Lets implement a Navbar in this project using React Bootstrap in Reactrb. First, we need to install Bootstrap and React Bootstrap:

	npm install bootstrap react-bootstrap --save

And then we need to `require` it in webpack/application.js

	ReactBootstrap = require('react-bootstrap')

I have also downloaded `bootstrap.css` and added it `assets/stylesheets`. This is a bit of a cheat as I am sure it can be included by Webpack, but for simplicity I have opted for this approach.

If you refresh your browser now and open the JavaScript console we will be able to interact with React Bootstrap

	ReactBootstrap

and you will see the ReactBootstrap object with all its components like Accordion, Alert, Badge, Breadcrumb, etc. This is great news, React Bootstrap is installed and ready to use. Accessing the JavaScript object in this way is a really great way to see what you have to work with. Sometimes the documentation of a component is not as accurate as actually seeing what you have in the component itself.

Lets recap for a second. We have Reactrb working with an initial component and we have React Bootstrap installed and ready to use, but there is a key piece of the puzzle missing. How do we bridge between Ruby and JavaScript so that we can use a JavaScript based library alongside our beautiful Ruby based components?

Reactrb makes this unbelievably easy which is a testament to its elegance, power and simplicity. We simply wrap the JavaScript library in a Ruby class and access it through Ruby. Lets do that next then we will be ready to write our Bootstrap Nav component in Ruby.

Create a new folder `views/components/shared` and add a file `bootstrap.rb` (I like to keep all my shared components in a specific folder and then one folder per application concept)

	module Components
		class Bs < React::NativeLibrary
			imports 'ReactBootstrap'
		end
	end

The code above defines a new class `Bs` which `imports` the JavaScript based React Bootstrap library for us to use in Ruby with our Reactrb components. We are wrapping a JavaScript library with a Ruby class.

Lets go ahead and create our Navbar::Show component in `views/components/navbar/show.rb`

	module Components
		module Navbar
			class Show < React::Component::Base

				def say_hello
					alert "Hello!"
				end

				def render
					div {
						div(id: "main-navbar") {
							Bs.Navbar(bsStyle: :inverse) {
								Bs.Nav {
									Bs.NavbarBrand { a(href: '#') {"Reactrb Showcase"} }
									Bs.NavDropdown(eventKey: 1, title: "Things", id: :drop_down) {
										(1..5).each do |n|
											Bs.MenuItem(key: n, eventKey: "1.#{n.to_s}", href: '#' ) {
												"Number #{n.to_s}"
											}.on(:click) { say_hello }
										end
									}
								}
							}
						}
					}
				end
			end
		end
	end

A few things to notice in the code above:

We add React Bootstrap components simply by `Bs.Name` where `Name` is the component you want to create. All the components are documented in the React Bootstrap [documentation](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html)

Notice how I have added an `.on(:click)` even handler to the `MenuItem` component while setting `href: '#'` as this will allow us to handle the event instead of navigating to a new page.

### Reactrb is powered by React

Reactrb and friends are in most cases simple DSL Ruby wrappers to the underlying native JavaScript libraries and React Components. It is really important to have a solid grip on how these technologies work to compliment your understanding of Reactrb. Most searches for help on Google will take you to examples written in JSX or ES6 JavaScript but you will learn over time to transalte this to Reactrb equivalents. To make headway with Reactrb you do need a solid understanding of the underlying philosophy of React and its component based architecture. The 'Thinking in React' tutorial below is an excellent place to start. (Make sure you see the Flux pattern in Reactrb above for an example of how to communicate between grandparent and child components).

### Opal under the covers

Reactrb is a DSL wrapper of React which uses Opal to compile Ruby code to ES5 native JavaScript. If you have not used Opal before then you should at a minimum read the excellent guides as they will teach you enough to get you started with Reactrb.
